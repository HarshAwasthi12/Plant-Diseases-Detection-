# 🌿 Plant Disease Detection System

This project is a Machine Learning-based web application that can detect plant diseases from leaf images using a trained deep learning model. It helps farmers or agriculture experts to identify potential diseases in plants efficiently.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🌱 Detect diseases in plant leaves via image upload
- 🧠 Trained using TensorFlow/Keras deep learning models
- 📊 Shows prediction with confidence score
- 🖼️ User-friendly UI (Streamlit or any web framework used)
- 📁 Supports common image formats (JPG, PNG)
- 🔬 Useful for agricultural analysis and precision farming
